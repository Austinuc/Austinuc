## Hi, I am Augustine ðŸ‘‹ 


I am a Java developer with experience building scalable and maintainable distributed microservices as well as monoliths. I am proficient in Java 8-17 and have experience with various Java frameworks such as Quarkus, Spring, Hibernate, and Struts.

I have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles and design patterns. I am also comfortable working with SQL databases and no SQL databases such as MYSQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong team player and have excellent communication skills. I am always eager to learn and continuously improve my skills.

You can find some of my work on GitHub, including personal projects and contributions to open source projects.
